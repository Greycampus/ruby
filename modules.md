**Modules**
=======

**A simple mixin with include**
```ruby
module SomeMixin
  def foo
    puts "foo!"
  end
end

class Bar
  include SomeMixin
  def baz
    puts "baz!"
  end
end

b = Bar.new
b.baz         # => "baz!"
b.foo         # => "foo!"
# works thanks to the mixin
```
Now `Bar` is a mix of its own methods and the methods from `SomeMixin`.

Note that how a mixin is used in a class depends on how it is added:

- The `include` keyword evaluates the module code in the class context (eg. method definitions will be methods on instances of the class),
- `Extend` will evaluate the module code in the context of the singleton class of the object (methods are available directly on the extended object).

Modules and Class Composition
-----------------------------

You can use Modules to build more complex classes through composition. The `include ModuleName` directive incorporates a module's methods into a class.
```ruby
module Foo
  def foo_method
    puts 'foo_method called!'
  end
end

module Bar
  def bar_method
    puts 'bar_method called!'
  end
end

class Baz
  include Foo
  include Bar

  def baz_method
    puts 'baz_method called!'
  end  
end
```
Baz now contains methods from both `Foo` and `Bar` in addition to its own methods.
```ruby
new_baz = Baz.new
new_baz.baz_method #=> 'baz_method called!'
new_baz.bar_method #=> 'bar_method called!'
new_baz.foo_method #=> 'foo_method called!'
```

A simple mixin with extend
--------------------------
A mixin is just a module that can be added (mixed in) to a class. one way to do it is with the extend method. The `extend` method adds methods of the mixin as class methods.
```ruby
module SomeMixin
  def foo
    puts "foo!"
  end
end

class Bar
  extend SomeMixin
  def baz
    puts "baz!"
  end
end

b = Bar.new
b.baz         # => "baz!"
b.foo         # NoMethodError, as the method was NOT added to the instance
Bar.foo       # => "foo!"
# works only on the class itself 
```

Module as Namespace
-------------------

Modules can contain other modules and classes:
```ruby
module Namespace

    module Child

        class Foo; end

    end # module Child

    # Foo can now be accessed as:
    #
    Child::Foo

end # module Namespace

# Foo must now be accessed as:
# 
Namespace::Child::Foo

```
